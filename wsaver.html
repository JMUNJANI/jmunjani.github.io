<p>Wsaver portal is a water distribution portal. In this project we are going to develop android application and PHP based web portal which involves supply of water tanks.In this portal local vendors and tanker owners complete the task. This tasks involve supply of water in different areas
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By accessing this portal user can order for water tanker at door step, give suggestion on the portal. The AMC maintains detail about all the vendors, tenders and water tanks. It is very useful or the citizens of country because they can give suggestion to government through this portal. As per requirement the water tank will be supplied.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="wrap-blockquote">The portal provides the notifications, gives attractive user interaction functionalities. So we can achieve more suggestions from user and task will be performed in proper manner.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p class="wrap-blockquote">In India, there is a major issue of water scarcity and many villages have become drought because of lack of efficient systems and proper planning. This project is based on Sensors that ease the functionality of project As each and every district/region/city have their different needs and different geographical regions so based on that, the system will decide how much water supply needs to be done to each and every area. There are mainly three users: Government, Municipal Corporations, Users. Once the system defines the amount of water to be allocated for that particular district/region/city then the government allows that amount of water to municipal corporations and municipal corporations will send the desired amount of water to be supplied to each area based on the area. The users will be allowed to use the desired amount of water at their respective place and if they exceed the desired amount of water then a fine has to be paid. More than that, at some places the water is supplied through water tankers. So, the users will be able to track the water tankers through the GPS system via a mobile application.</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p class="wrap-blockquote">The purpose of this project is to define how much water the district/region/city will use for based on geographical regions and needs.
The system will define the amount of water needed to be allocated and the government will allow the same for municipal corporations and municipal corporations will supply it to the respective users.The users will get a mobile application to track the water tanker if they are being supplied through a water tanker and an automation system to control the water usage. Here the users are the society representatives for better convenience.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>It has been a great pleasure for us to work on this exciting and challenging project. This project proved good for us as it provided practical knowledge of not only programming in PHP web based applications and in Android to some extent SQL Server, and also about handling all procedures related with “Water tankers”. It also provides knowledge about the latest technology used in developing web enabled applications and client server technology that will be in great demand in future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The project is identified by the merits of the system offered to the user. The merits of this project are as follows:-</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s a web-enabled project.</li>
  <li>This project offers users to enter the data through simple and interactive forms. This is very helpful for the client to enter the desired information through so much simplicity.</li>
  <li>The user is mainly more concerned about the validity of the data, whatever he is entering. There are checks on every stages of any new creation, data entry or updating so that the user cannot enter the invalid data, which can create problems at later date </li>
</ul>
